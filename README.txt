Package for R that adds a new feature to the rglplot function originally present in the igraph package.

The original function did not support scaling for the font size of vertex labels. This new package does support this by passing the vertex.label.cex argument with a multiplier.

ex.
vertex.label.cex=2 will double the font size of the vertex labels.
vertex.label.cex=0.5 will halve the font size of the vertex labels.
